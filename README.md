Project 1: Formula 1 British Grand Prix Sprint Analysis

As a fan of Formula 1, this is my first major data analysis project. The data for this project is pulled from Kaggle and uses R and RStudio as the primary programming language for analysis. All files are explored for their general purposes on the kaggle page and Microsoft Excel to determine the most necessary datasets for this analysis. The working directory in RStudio is then set to the folder dataset with the corresponding libraries and datasets, four specific tables are then loaded 'Sprint Results', 'Races', 'Drivers', and 'Results'. The data for each table is cleaned to remove unnecessary data unrelated to the 2021 season and parsed further down into the races that involved sprint qualifying sessions. Inner joins are performed to combine the data into a single data frame and the new table is filtered for the British GP. The data is then explored and visualized with ggplot to gain insight on how the Sprint Qualifying of the British Grand Prix affected the overall results of the final race.

*Due to the extensive nature of the Formula 1 data set and the soon to be ending of the 2022 season, future analyses may be performed to gain more insight on various grand prix's and this motorsport.*

Project 2: Covid Analysis with Data Frames built in SQL and exported into Tableau for visualization

The Covid-19 Data is pulled from Our World in Data, data frame will  and separated into two worksheets one for Covid-19 Vaccinations and a second for Covid-19 Deaths, the two worksheets are loaded into Microsoft SQL Server 2019. The data is then explored and parsed through using SQL queries, separated into 4 different views and exported into Tableau Public to be visualized in a dashboard.


Project 3: Movie Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis using Python within Jupyter Notebook

Movie Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis pulls data from Kaggle, the purpose of this project is to explore the data and determine any possible correlations between the different categories. Once the data has been downloaded and loaded into Python with the appropriate libraries, begin exploration by seeing what lies in the data and deriving possible questions. Data is transformed and sorted to be read easier when viewing the data frame and finally visualized using three different correlation tables (Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman) to gather insights on what factors are most likely to play a role in a movie's success or failure.

Project 4: Data Exploration of Housing Prices in Nashville

This project a series of SQL queries that is used to explore the varying housing prices in Nashville
